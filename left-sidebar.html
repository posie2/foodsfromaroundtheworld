									  Myanmar's name was changed to Myanmar in 1989. It was known as Burma beforehand. Although it is easier to say Myanmar, the offical name was "Union of Myanmar" and then they changed it again to "Republic of the Union of Myanmar". These changes occured because basically, the name Burma was the name Burma because more Burman or otherwise known as Bamar people lived their than any other race. To make the name more welcoming to people who were not Bamar, they changed it to Myanmar, which means a similar thing yet more formal in the Burmese language. Myanmar is ruled by a Military junta, or Military leaders. As a result of the fact that about "68%" (an image I found on Council on Foreign Relations Myanmar's Troubled History: Coups, Military Rule, and Ethnic Conflict) of the people who live in Myanmar are Burman or Bamar, lots of discrimintation occured to the people who weren't Burman. The Military was harsh, and attacked villages and people, and arrested people who tried to stand up. Some people describe it as a humongous civil war, which makes sense because it sounds like some of what is happening actually also happened in the United States of America, just later. The Military junta was so harsh against people who weren't Bamar, that they lost a lot of dignity, or were not as respected as other people. Aung San Suu Kyi was a protestor who protested, and then had to go to prison and house arrest. She was supported by a lot of people, but didn't actually make much of a difference, according to one person. She actually earned a Nobel Peace Prize while she was under house arrest. Mayanmar was named Myanmar to be more inclusive to people who weren't Bamar, and to try earn some respect. So much violence has occured, that many refugees had to seek a safe place to live in other countries, including the United States of America.
