	Afghanistan gained freedom from Britain in 1921, but there were much more problems to follow. As a result of the war that took place in order for 
	freedom, Amir Amanullah Khan thought that they needed a monarchy, and made himself the king. People weren't too happy about that, so he left the 
	country and Zahir Shah was the king and gave peace to the counry for 40 years! Women's rights keep increasing and they gain an ally as years go by. 
	A secret group forms named "The Afghan Communist Party". Khan becomes king, and keeps increasing women's rights, as well as abolishing the monarchy 
	and instead making himself president, in 1973 - 1977. The khan was killed by the communist group I mentioned earlier. Many leaders have been 
	killed, and there has been much violence. The Taliban, which is a group that is Muslim and wants to support the Islam religion in anyway possible, 
	enters Afghanistan in 1995. Since Afghanistan had had many problems in the past, some people supported the Taliban. The Taliban pushed everyone to 
	follow the Islam religion, and created laws that enforced that. For example, they decided to make women do certain things, such as not have an 
	education, under the excuse that it was a belief under Islam, yet some people who are Muslim disagree, and say that is wrong - but that is later. 
	In 1995, they made women wear veils and be with a man outside. These strict rules on women continued to increase, and more problems escalate 
	forcing many people to leave their homes and become refugees. They also continue to enforce the Islam religion and destroy other religions in 
	Afghanistan. In 2001, people finally stand up against the Taliban. They go to war, and the Taliban leaves Afghanistan. Violence was very often 
	prominent in Afghanistan, which is a big reason why many people were forced to leave. The Taliban took over Afghanistan again in 2021, and they 
	continue to enforce Islam and rules for women until now. The conflict is not over, in Afghanistan women still can't go to school over 6th grade. 
	The violence and not freedom of religion and rules against women are why so many people were forced to leave their home behind. The flag above is 
	the same flag the Taliban uses.
