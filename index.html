							<h2><a href="#">Why is it important to learn about foods in different places?</a></h2>
							<p>
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							I was inspired to make this website by the book Everything Sad is Untrue by Daniel Nayeri. In the book, Daniel sometimes feels out of place with what he eats. When his friend Kyle came over to his house, he refused to eat what they had just because he hadn't ever had it before. This concept comes up many times throughout the book. This is probably still coming up today, and the sooner we can recognize foods from different places, the more open to them we can be. This could make a small difference in how welcomed refugees who are coming to Colorado feel.
