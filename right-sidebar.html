										<h2><a href="#">The Democratic Republic of the Congo</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="TDROTCF.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										The Democratic Republic of the Congo actually changed the name of their country several times, but the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the name of the country now. It is a country with many people suffering from much poverty. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the poorest 5 nations on earth. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has many resources, like cobalt and more! Unfortunately, there is a shortage of food for many people in the country so many people suffer from hunger. There have been many instances of discrimination also. At first, the government didn't have a lot of power, so lots of violence occured. There was a lot of conflict between 1960 and 1965 because it was uncertain whether Europeans or Congolese people had the most power to run the country. There was much conflict, and so to try and have peace, in 1971, they renamed the country the "Republic of Zaire", in order for peace and respect for all cultures. All these name changes occured for many reasonss. When the Europeans came to the country a long time ago, they encouraged people to set up trading spots along the river and unite a bit, which was when an earlier name change occured, although there were more before that. The European king that ruled the land was prejudiced and harsh sometimes though. When Belgium ruled the Democratic Republic of the Congo instead of the king of Belgium, they decided things that would happen, and some people didn't like that they were sometimes forcing people to work in shops, so there were riots. Then after this, they were a free country seperate from Belgium and changed there name again. President Mobutu thought that the only way for African people to be respected was to stop Europeans from practicing what they did so he stopped him from doing this. He wanted to name the country something that wasn't European inspired. The word "Congo" used to be spelled "Kongo" but the Europeans changed it to a c. A main river in the country is named "Congo", but since that was European inspired, President Mobutu changed the name of the country to the original name of the river (which they changed back to "Zaire") which was "Zaire". When President Mobutu died, they changed the name to "The Democratic Republic of the Congo", which was very similar to a previouc name "The Republic of the Congo".
